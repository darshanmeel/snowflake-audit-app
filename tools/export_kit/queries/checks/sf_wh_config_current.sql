-- title: Warehouse configuration (current)
-- domain: compute   tier: lite
-- windowed: no
-- pre: SHOW WAREHOUSES
-- reads: SHOW WAREHOUSES, SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
-- requires: IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database; MONITOR on the warehouses (SHOW WAREHOUSES
--   lists only warehouses the role can see)
-- params: none
-- confidence: needs_confirmation
-- confidence_note: Not yet run on a live account.
-- read_this: One row = one warehouse SHOW WAREHOUSES lists now. The columns that matter are
--   warehouse_size, min_clusters/max_clusters (multi-cluster bounds) and auto_stop_minutes (how
--   long the warehouse waits before suspending). warehouse_generation is GEN1, GEN2, SNOWPARK_OPTIMIZED or
--   ADAPTIVE and credits_per_hour is the Service Consumption Table rate for it (an estimate input, not
--   billed spend; NULL for adaptive, which has no fixed rate).
-- healthy: n/a - inventory
-- investigate_if: n/a - inventory
-- actions: n/a - inventory, nothing to act on
-- next: none
-- caveats: Tags come from TAG_REFERENCES (see access_tags_inventory). SHOW WAREHOUSES lists only
--   warehouses the role can see.
WITH -- Current warehouse settings from the SHOW WAREHOUSES run just before (a check's `-- pre:` line),
-- with the numeric id taken from metering history by name. credits_per_hour is the Service
-- Consumption Table rate for the size, generation and resource constraint (rate_multiplier is its
-- ratio to a Gen1 standard warehouse of the same size; multi-cluster warehouses pay it per running
-- cluster; an estimate input, never billed spend). SHOW returns the counts and
-- auto_suspend as NUMBER, so they are cast, not TRY_TO_NUMBER'd (that takes text only).
-- An ADAPTIVE warehouse has no size, cluster counts or auto_suspend in SHOW, so those stay NULL.
